                                            <li>Body Mechanics offer a variety of body treatments including therapeutic massage, facials, body polish, mud wraps, and even a “retreat for the feet.” Body Mechanics offers massages in sessions of 30, 60 or 90 minutes, using a combination of Swedish, Deep Tissue, and Muscular massages. Body Mechanics even specializes in pregnancy massage for those women who are expecting. Each session is tailored specifically to the customer’s needs. If a person has neck problems, more time will be spent in that area. The result is that no two customers get the same massage. In addition to relieving stress, massage also helps relieve symptoms of Fibromyalgia and headaches. Those with Multiple Sclerosis may also experience benefits because massage keeps the muscles supple.</li>

                                            <li>The Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (OSJA, ) JAG, or Legal Office) is responsible for providing legal advice and client services in the six main legal disciplines for the U.S. Army – Military Justice, Administrative and Civil Law (including Contracts and Labor law), Legal Assistance, Claims, and Operational Law. The Legal Office offers free legal assistance to ID cardholders on topics such as powers of attorney, wills, trusts, estates, taxes, divorces, adoptions, name changes, and notarizations. One thing you and your spouse should seriously consider is creating a power of attorney. The power of attorney gives legal authority for one spouse to conduct legitimate business on the other’s behalf. Powers of Attorney (POA) can be established for a myriad of things ranging from giving one spouse the ability to register a vehicle in the other’s name all the way to purchasing a house in their name. The post Legal Office will be able to provide you more detailed information regarding each state’s view of POAs and what business transactions require a POA. Additional information regarding the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate General can be found at <a href="http://www.rucker.army.mil/sja/">http://www.rucker.army.mil/sja/</a></li>

                                            <li>Many military spouses may face both personal and financial issues during periods of separation due to deployments or Temporary Duty (TDY). To handle these matters, you should to be prepared. Many military couples use a POA as a legal instrument during geographic separations. Two types of POAs exist. A General POA enables the spouse to conduct all the Soldier’s personal affairs, while the Special POA is used for only one specific purpose, (e.g., to sell or register a car or house). Soldiers should authorize POAs for only a limited time so that the document can be reviewed and revised at certain intervals (e.g., for one year). The Legal Assistance Office can assist in drafting, notarizing, and witnessing a POA. The Legal Assistance Office will also assist in drawing up wills. Most Soldiers and spouses should have a will directing disposition of assets, especially if they have children or own real estate.</li>

It supports the chain of command by identifying QOL issues and concerns, and by providing recommendations for QOL improvement. It also encourages and assists single Soldiers in identifying and planning for innovative and fun-filled recreational and leisure activities as well as community service projects. BOSS program eligibility and participation is open to all single Soldiers, which is defined as all unmarried, divorced, widowed, and unaccompanied Soldiers, to include single parent Soldiers. BOSS sponsored events may be open to all, with preference and priority to the single Soldier. Council and Event Planning Meetings are open to all Soldiers and organizations that would like to participate in BOSS. Council Meetings are held every third Wednesday and Event Planning Meetings are held every Wednesday from 4 – 5 p.m. at the BOSS Building (Bldg. 8350). The meetings cover quality of life issues, community service projects, and leisure activities and trips. Weekly meetings ensure that the voices of single Soldiers are heard.</li>
